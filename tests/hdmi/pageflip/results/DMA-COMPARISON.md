# Scanout profiling comparison

Queued-read limit: 4 → 4.
FIFO payload capacity: 512 → 512 bytes; additional reorder storage: 512 → 512 bytes.
An original-to-pipelined comparison includes extra buffering; same-design limit comparisons hold physical storage constant.

Largest tested zero-underflow model latency: 400 → 400 cycles.
Change in sampled passing-latency bound: +0.00%.
These are sampled bounds, not proven maxima. If the candidate passes the entire sweep, extend the latency range before claiming its limit.
Wire-byte throughput is recorded separately in results.json and is not used as a substitute for useful displayed pixels.
